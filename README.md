This AI-powered platform combines three advanced financial models:

Private Equity Waterfall Distribution: An interactive tool for calculating and visualizing cash distributions in private equity deals.
Leveraged Buyout (LBO) Model with Multi-Scenario Analysis: Dynamically evaluates capital structuring decisions in LBOs.
Monte Carlo Simulations: Forecasts financial outcomes and risk probabilities using advanced stochastic methods.
The application employs AI techniques (GBDT, Q-Learning, Policy Gradient Methods) and React-based interactive UI for seamless and intelligent financial modeling.

Working:
1. Backend Models
Private Equity Waterfall Model:
Accepts input for capital calls, return rates, and carried interest.
Computes LP (Limited Partner) and GP (General Partner) distributions over multiple periods.
Visualizes cash flows via interactive charts to help stakeholders assess fund performance.

LBO Model:
Optimizes capital structuring decisions (debt vs. equity allocation) using Q-learning.
Accepts inputs like initial debt, equity, and projected cash flows.
Simulates equity growth under various scenarios, helping investors identify the most profitable financing strategies.

Monte Carlo Simulations:
Uses Policy Gradient Methods to optimize portfolio allocation and forecast potential outcomes.
Simulates thousands of possible financial paths based on historical or synthetic data.
Visualizes distribution of outcomes (e.g., portfolio value, ROI) to help in risk assessment.

2. Frontend User Experience
The React-based UI ensures an intuitive workflow:
Data Inputs: Users enter financial parameters through easy-to-use forms.
API Integration: Inputs are sent to the backend for computation.
Interactive Results: Outputs (e.g., cash distributions, equity values, simulation results) are visualized in real-time using dynamic charts and graphs powered by Plotly.
Navigation: A sleek menu allows switching between models for comprehensive financial analysis.

3. AI-Driven Automation
The application uses ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) paradigms:
Reasoning: AI interprets user queries to determine the appropriate model.
Acting: Executes calculations and visualizations dynamically.
Enables fully automated workflows, reducing manual efforts and errors.
